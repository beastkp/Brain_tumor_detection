# Brain_tumor_detection
This model Predicts the early possibilities of occurrence of Brain tumor based on MRI Images. Detects Mainly 3 types of tumors Glioma, Meningioma and Pituitary tumor


## Models Used 
A Pre-trained model VGG16 is used for this purpose which works exceptionally well on MRI and CT scanned images. This model was used after training the dataset on a multiple logistic regression. It yielded an accuracy of 60% which was not that good which eventually led to the selection of VGG.

## Dataset 
The dataset used for training purpose has 3 different classes and is available on kaggle, for testing purposes the dataset that was used is different from the training dataset. 

## Accuracy 
The Validation Accuracy of the final trained model is 93.71% and the Testing Accuracy is of 91.74%
